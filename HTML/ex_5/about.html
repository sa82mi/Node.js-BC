    <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
        \content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
        publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
        model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
